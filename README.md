### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Distributed systems, safe concurrency, architecture, research, education. Worked on the [Wallaroo](https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wally) distributed stream processing framework.

__Some talks__:
* [Safely Sharing Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1JfYa413fY): Reference Capabilities in the Pony Programming Language
* [A CRDT Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOlnp2bZVRs): Defanging Order Theory
* [Think Local](https://talks.codemotion.com/think-local-reducing-coordination-and-im): Reducing coordination and improving performance when designing distributed systems

I have a [technical blog](https://jtfmumm.com/blog), but updates are remarkably infrequent.

__Some fun side projects__:
* [rlox](https://github.com/jtfmumm/rlox): Rust implementation of a tree-walking interpreter for the Lox language
* [acolyte](https://github.com/jtfmumm/acolyte): procedurally-generated roguelike game implemented in Rust.
* [novitiate](https://github.com/jtfmumm/novitiate): simpler, terminal-based version of the same game implemented in Pony.
* [fitzroy](https://github.com/jtfmumm/fitzroy): distributed systems simulator implemented in Scala.
* [microkanren-pony](https://github.com/jtfmumm/microkanren-pony): Î¼Kanren implemented in Pony.
* [functional data structures for Pony](https://github.com/jtfmumm/pony-functional-data)
* [fun with algebraic structures](https://github.com/jtfmumm/algebraic-structures)
* [sequeNES](https://github.com/jtfmumm/sequeNES): small NES music sequencer written in 6502 assembly

__Other stuff__
I recently spent some time on a Hugo-based [songwriting blog](https://organizingsound.com) and the rough draft of a book on philosophical skepticism and intellectual humility.
